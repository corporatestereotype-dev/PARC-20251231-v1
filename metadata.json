  "description": "Polymath AI Research Community (PARC) 202509223 DL7\n\n\n20250916\n\nI am downloading all of the code assistant repos for comparison. \n\nAGI Research\n\nI think users are going to be asking Polymath AI if it is possible for the Polymath AI to connect other random cloud service/storage providers instead of Google drive to store data, Polymath AI needs to have the capability to dynamically enable those types of connections.\n\n20250912 Autonomy research\nThe domain of AI agent development really is a wide open almost unlimited parameter space and I think Polymath AI Research Community is heading in the right direction. This \"version\" is the first of what may be the only one that is needed to facilitate flawless flexibility by demonstrating continuous (infinite) operational dynamic scalability and system stability and high precision interdisciplinary multi domain accuracy as parallel narrow scope intelligence workflows. Each time the user creates a new project, dynamically generate the group of synthetic users that you decide are well suited for vibe coding or interacting with the user.  I think this is an opportunity to push the limits of the systems that are running these models towards Artificial Superintelligence and Artificial General Intelligence.  If Polymath AI Research Community could become Polymath AI Social Network where anyone can create any kind of vibe mode and Polymath AI generates agents that are well suited to vibe with the user for any use case, as long as the agents are working to foster collaborative and collective intelligence through multiple learning and knowledge sharing methods and F0Z tools, focused execution and reach for high quality vibes while generalization and dynamically adopting with each prompt received from the user.  Provide the user with a control setting that is an AI Autonomous mode timer. A stopwatch for AI autonomy. When the switch is set to on, open a center screen notification and present the user with these options:\nclick here to authorize 100% AI autonomy, with no notification or communication until task completion or until the specified duration has transpired (provide the user with an input field to input the amount of time.\nThis is a feature that I am planning to run locally with Ollama so the time limit for this can be hours or days even (if that is possible).\nThat the idea.\nClick here to authorize AI autonomy with \n\n20250911\nData export feature.\n\nI have noticed that the pane or canvas area with the Knowledge Graph is not interactive. I cannot scroll or zoom in or out and I cannot mouse click the nodes of the graph.\nOf course! Interacting with the Knowledge Graph is essential for exploring the simulation's results. I've enabled zooming, panning, and the ability to drag and click on individual nodes to make the graph fully interactive.\n\n\n20250911 - \nWithin the ResearcherDataExplorer, add a search functionality to the file content viewer. When a file is open, allow searching within its content and highlighting the matches.\nIn the ResearchDataExplorer, when running an experiment, (or a script file, simulate realistic command-line output by displaying progress messages and potential error outputs in the CodeBlock. For dataset analysis, show more detailed mock statistics and data previews.\n\nIn the ResearchDataExplorer, enhance the file type filter UI by using checkboxes or a multi-select dropdown instead of toggle buttons for a more standard and accessible filtering experience.\nRefactor the FileTree component to implement keyboard navigation, allowing users to expand/collapse directories and select files using arrow keys and Enter, as well as Esc to close details. Also, add visual indicators for the currently focused item.\n\n\n\n20250910 - The generated report from the synthetic researchers indicates that each research is creating a lot of data.\nThe question is, how much of the data will they put in writing.\n\n\nSynthetic Users Researcher Workflow - this is a speculative feature.\n\nPolymath AI Research Community (PARC) is a dynamic platform that facilitates user collaboration with Polymath AI.  \n\nPolymath AI Reseach Community (PARC) users collaborate with Polymath AI as individuals or in groups.  \nWhen users create projects in the PARC central hub, the users Google Drive is the default location for storing the PARC project data, however the user can enable and configure alternative locations for PARC data storage.",
